### Prototype Hackathon 2.0 

## project - `Carbon Footprint Tracker`

## about 
I created a web application that calculates users’ personal carbon footprints based on their daily activities — including travel, food consumption, shopping, and electricity usage.
The app provides personalized insights and actionable suggestions to help users reduce their environmental impact.
Built using React for the frontend and Node.js (or your tech stack) on the backend, with data-driven calculations based on global emissions standards.
